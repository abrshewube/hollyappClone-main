            <h2>How we collect information</h2>

            <p>We collect information by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. We also let you know
                why
                we’re
                collecting it and how it will be used. You are free to refuse our request for this information, with the
                understanding
                that we may be unable to provide you with some of your desired services without it.</p>

                the
                specifics
                of this information publicly.</p>

            <p>
                If you opted into our newsletter, we may use your personal details to contact you with updates about our

            <h2>Data processing and storage</h2>

            <p>The personal information we collect is stored and processed where we or our third-party
                providers maintain facilities. We only transfer data within jurisdictions subject to data protection
                laws that
                reflect
                our commitment to protecting the privacy of our users.</p>

            <p>We only retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide a service, or to improve our
                services
                in
                future. While we retain this data, we will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent
                loss and
                theft,
                as well as unauthorised access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. That said, we advise that no
                method of
                electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and cannot guarantee absolute data security.</p>

            <p>If you request your personal information be deleted, or where your personal information becomes no longer
                relevant to
                our operations, we will erase it from our system within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

            <h2>Third-party access to information</h2>

            <p>We use third-party services for:</p>

                <li>Realtime updates</li>
                <li>Application server hosting</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These services may access our data solely for the purpose of performing specific tasks on our behalf.
                We do not give them permission to
                disclose or use any of our data for any other purpose.</p>

            <p>We will refuse government and law enforcement requests for data if we believe a request is too broad or
                unrelated to
                its stated purpose. However, we may cooperate if we believe the requested information is necessary and
                appropriate to
                comply with legal process, to protect our own rights and property, to protect the safety of the public
                and any
                person,
                to prevent a crime, or to prevent what we reasonably believe to be illegal, legally actionable, or
                unethical
                activity.</p>

            <p>We do not otherwise share or supply personal information to third parties. We do not sell or rent your

            <h2>Cookies</h2>

            <p>We use cookies to help improve your experience of <a href="index.html"
                                                                    class="hyperlink">http://hollyapp.com</a>. This
                cookie
                policy is part of our privacy policy, and covers the use of cookies between your device and our
                site.</p>

            <p>If you don’t wish to accept cookies from us, you should instruct your browser to refuse cookies from
                <a href="index.html" class="hyperlink">http://hollyapp.com</a>, with the understanding that we may be
                unable to
                provide you
                with some of your desired content and services.</p>

            <h3>What is a cookie?</h3>

            <p>A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on your device when you visit, typically
                containing
                information about the website itself, a unique identifier that allows the site to recognise your web
                browser
                when you
                return, additional data that serves the purpose of the cookie, and the lifespan of the cookie
                itself.</p>

            <p>Cookies are used to enable certain features (eg. logging in) or store your user
                settings (eg. timezone, notification preferences).</p>

            <p>Cookies set by the website you are visiting are normally referred to as “first-party cookies”, and
                typically
                only
                track your activity on that particular site. Cookies set by other sites and companies (ie. third
                parties) are
                called
                “third-party cookies”, and can be used to track you on other websites that use the same third-party
                service.</p>

            <h3>Types of cookies and how we use them</h3>

            <h4>Essential cookies</h4>

            <p>Essential cookies are crucial to your experience of a website, enabling core features like user logins
                We use essential cookies to enable certain functions on our
                website.</p>

            <h4>Functionality cookies</h4>

            <p>Functionality cookies are used in collecting information about your device and any settings you may
                configure
                on the
                website you’re visiting (like language and timezone settings). With this information, websites can
                provide you
                with
                customised, enhanced or optimised content and services. We use functionality cookies for selected
                features on
                our site.</p>

            <h3>How you can control or opt out of cookies</h3>

            <p>If you do not wish to accept cookies from us, you can instruct your browser to refuse cookies from our
                website.
                Most
                browsers are configured to accept cookies by default, but you can update these settings to either refuse
                cookies
                altogether, or to notify you when a website is trying to set or update a cookie.</p>

            <p>If you browse websites from multiple devices, you may need to update your settings on each individual
                device.
            </p>

            <p>Although some cookies can be blocked with little impact on your experience of a website, blocking all
                cookies
                may
                mean you are unable to access certain features and content across the sites you visit.</p>
