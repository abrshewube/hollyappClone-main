            <h2>4. GRANT OF LICENSE TO HOLLYCORP</h2>

            <p><b>As between you and HollyCorp, you exclusively own all rights in and to the Contributions that you
                    submit to
                    the Holly Site.</b> HollyCorp needs a limited license from you so that we can use your Contributions
                to make
                the Holly Services and Holly Site available to you. For example, if you submit copyrighted text material
                the
                Holly Site, we need a license from you to display, perform and distribute these Contributions in order
                to make
                these Contributions available to you on your Trees. And, if you permit third parties (such as your
                customers or
                consultants) to view your Trees, we need to have a license to sub-license your Contributions to these
                third
                parties so that they can view and use your Trees.</p>

            <p>By making a Contribution to the Holly Site, you grant to HollyCorp a limited, perpetual, non-exclusive
                (meaning
                you are free to license your Contribution to anyone else in addition to HollyCorp), fully-paid,
                royalty-free
                (meaning that HollyCorp is not required to pay you to use your Contribution), sub-licensable (subject to
                the
                restrictions below), transferable (solely because we need the right to transfer this license to a
                successor
                Holly Site operator) and worldwide (because the Internet and the Holly Site are global in reach) license
                to use,
                modify, perform, display, reproduce and distribute the Contribution <b>for the sole purpose of operating
                    the
                    Holly Site and Holly Services</b>. HollyCorp needs the right to "modify" and "reproduce" your
                Content, because
                the software and servers hosting the Holly Site modify and reproduce your Content automatically in order
                to make
                the Holly Site and Holly Service available.</p>

            <p>We will only sublicense your Contribution for the following purposes: (a) to make your Contributions
                available
                to any third party (such as a client or a contractor) that you permit to view your Trees on the Holly
                Site; and
                (b) to permit a third party hosted services provider to host the Holly Site.</p>


            <h2>5. RESTRICTIONS</h2>

            <p>Customer shall not: (a) rent, lease or loan the Holly Service; (b) conduct automated functionality tests
                or

                a
                disproportionate amount of the Holly Service that interrupts or degrades the Holly Service; or (d) use
                the Holly

            <h2>7. SUBSCRIPTIONS AND PAYMENT</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><b>7.1 Evaluation Trial.</b> When the Customer subscribes to a paid Plan (hereby creating a
                    "Subscription")
                    for the first time, the Customer's Account is automatically placed on a 30 day free evaluation trial
                    (the
                    "Evaluation Trial"). During the Evaluation Trial the Account shall have access to the full
                    functionality of
                    the selected paid Plan. HollyCorp will not bill the Customer subscription fees for the duration of
                    the
                    Evaluation Trial. If the Customer doesn't cancel the Subscription before the end of the Evaluation
                    Trial, the
                    Subscription will transition to a regular, non-evaluation Subscription with costs as described on
                    the Plan
                    Selection Page. The user is entitled to receive an Evaluation Trial for its first Subscription only.
                    Subsequent Subscriptions will not be placed on an Evaluation Trial. If a User is a company, only one
                    employee
                    or consultant of such User is entitled to receive the Evaluation Trial.
                </li>

                <li><b>7.2 Subscription Fees.</b> The amount of the Subscription Fees, if any, are determined by the
                    Plan
                    selected on the Plan Selection Page. If a Paid User wants to add more Collaborators than are
                    permitted under
                    Paid User’s Plan limits, the Paid User must upgrade to a Plan with higher Collaborator limits.
                    Subscription
                    Fees for the new Plan will be calculated on a pro-rated basis for the remainder of the Term. In the
                    event of
                    cancellation or termination of this Agreement, no refunds will be made. User is responsible for all
                    taxes,
                    other than taxes levied on HollyCorp’s income. Subscription Fees do not include any applicable
                    taxes. If
                    HollyCorp is required to pay any sales, use, goods and services, value added, or other taxes in
                    relation to
                    Paid User’s purchase, those taxes will be billed to and paid by Paid User.
                </li>

                <li><b>7.3 Payment.</b> Paid User shall pay the Subscription Fees to HollyCorp on the date Paid User
                    upgrades to
                    a paid Plan (the "Subscription Date") and on every monthly anniversary thereof during the term of
                    the
                    Agreement. All Subscription Fees will be automatically billed to Paid User’s credit card. Paid User
                    may
                    upgrade from a paid Plan to another paid Plan at any point during the then-current billing cycle,
                    and Paid
                    User will be immediately charged, on a pro-rated basis, for the remainder of the then-current
                    billing cycle.
                    If either party terminates the Agreement before the end of the then-current term, HollyCorp shall
                    not refund
                    any fees to Paid User.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>7.4 Receipts.</b> HollyCorp will periodically send the Paid Users receipts for
                    Subscription Fees that were billed to the Paid User's credit card. Receipts are
                    sent electronically to an e-mail address chosen by the Customer when he signed up to a Paid Plan.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>7.5 Cancellation. </b>
                    Paid users can cancel their Subscription from the Account Overview Page.
                    No refunds will be made for cancelled subscriptions.
                    Instead cancelled Subscriptions will allow the User to use the full functionality of the selected
                    Plan until the next monthly anniversary of the Subscription Date, at which point the Account will
                    transition
                    to the free Plan as described on the Plan Selection Page. If the Account exceeds the limits
                    associated with
                    the free Plan, the User will have limited access to his Account until the Account is either (a)
                    brought below
                    the free Plan limits or (b) User purchases a paid Plan for which such Account qualifies.

            <h2>8. TERMINATION AND SURVIVAL</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><b>8.1 Termination.</b> Either party may immediately terminate this Agreement as follows: (a) if
                    either
                    party materially breaches its obligations under this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within
                    thirty
                    (30) days after it has been notified in writing of such breach; or (b) if either party has
                    instituted against
                    it any proceedings seeking relief, reorganization or arrangement under any laws relating to
                    insolvency and
                    such proceeding is not resolved within sixty (60) days.
                </li>
                <li><b>8.2 Survival.</b> The provisions of Sections 1, 2.4, 2.5, 3-5, 7.2, 7.3 and 8-17 shall survive
                    the
                    cancellation or termination of this Agreement. All other provisions of this Agreement, which by
                    their terms or
                    import are intended to survive such cancellation or termination, shall survive.

            <ul>
                <li><b>10.1 Definition.</b> "Confidential Information" shall mean all non-public information, whether in
                    oral,
                    written or other tangible form that either party ("Discloser") discloses to the other party
                    ("Recipient") as
                    being confidential, including without limitation the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
                    Notwithstanding
                    the foregoing, Confidential Information does not include information that: (a) is or becomes
                    generally
                    available to the public other than (i) as a result of a disclosure by Recipient or its employees or
                    any other
                    person who directly or indirectly receives such information from Discloser or its employees or (ii)

                    governmental body; provided that Recipient shall provide prompt notice thereof to Discloser so as to
                    afford
                    Discloser an opportunity to intervene and prevent or limit any such disclosure.
                </li>
                <li><b>10.2 Non-Disclosure and Non-Use Obligation.</b> Recipient shall not make use of (except for

                    Recipient shall
                    treat Discloser’s Confidential Information with the same degree (but not less than a reasonable
                    degree) of

            <h2>15. GOVERNING LAW</h2>

            <p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under German laws, without regard to that state’s

                timely injunctive relief to protect HollyCorp’s rights under this Agreement in addition to any and all
                remedies
                available at law.</p>


            <h2>17. MISCELLANEOUS</h2>

            <p>This Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties on the subject matter hereof. No amendment or
                modification hereof will be valid or binding upon the parties unless made in writing and signed by the
                duly
                authorized representatives of both parties. The relationship of the parties hereunder is that of
                independent
                contractors, and this Agreement will not be construed to imply that either party is the agent, employee,
                or
                joint venturer of the other. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held to be
                unenforceable, this
                Agreement will continue in full force and effect without said provision and will be interpreted to
                reflect the
                original intent of the parties. Customer may not assign this Agreement (by operation of law or
                otherwise)
                without the prior written consent of HollyCorp and any prohibited assignment will be null and void. This
                Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties permitted successors and/or
                assignees. Waiver by either party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement or the failure by
                either party
                to exercise any right hereunder will not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of
                that
                right or as a waiver of any other right. </p>
